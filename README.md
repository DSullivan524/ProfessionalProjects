# ProfessionalProjects


This repository contains all the code and programs that I write during classes or through the process of learning a certain coding language.

This repository will consist of different coding languages, and I will periodically update this repository as I write more programs and code.
I will seperate the different languages into their own seperate folder along with their own README's to breifly explain each program that folder contains.
